The life of the party; you thrive on bringing people together, socialising and planning big events.</p><p>People love you because you’re warm, accepting of everyone, have a crazy amount of positive energy and a can-do attitude to boot.</p><p>Outgoing meets outdoorsy, you love camping, climbing and exploring the unknown. A daredevil, always looking forward to your next challenge, your next great adventure.</p><p>We don’t know how you do it, but keep up the good work.</p>"

You couldn’t think a bad thought if you tried and this shines out of you, making you look lovely at every age.</p><p>You are refined, calm and loving and your friends know they can always count on you in times of need. Often times too generous, you have a tendency to see the good in everyone and put their needs before your own. Don’t forget to treat yourself every now and then. You’re too wonderful for your own good.</p><p>Favourite past-times include: hugging and helping.</p>"

Learning fun facts is your idea of fun and you’re the captain of analysing and strategising on game night.</p><p>Your mix of sophistication, humour and wit, makes you fun and exciting to be around. Many wouldn’t know, as you reserve your personality for a select few; shining brightest when surrounded by loved ones. You prefer hanging with a tight-knit circle of friends to attending a big bash any day.

Your understanding of what people are thinking and feeling allows you to diffuse situations better than most bomb experts. You step back, take your time, see the bigger picture, and only intervene when it’s absolutely necessary.</p><p>When you’re not people watching at a local cafe, and diffusing family feuds, you’re getting back to nature. Whether it’s gardening in the backyard or camping in the outback, nature always seems to make you feel better.</p><p>People describe you as down-to-earth, kind, generous, balanced and stable.</p>"

You use this knowledge, power and integrity to inspire higher ideals.</p><p>You emit a quiet knowing, and people are drawn to it like moths to a flame. It’s the feeling people get when they lay on their backs and look up at the midnight sky.</p><p>Favourite past-times include: reading on your Kindle and listening to bands nobody’s ever heard of.</p>"

You value your friends and family above all else and probably have a mantlepiece littered with sentimental mementos. You crave peace and harmony, but aren’t afraid to get rough to protect the ones you love.</p><p>Your need for peace and harmony transcends into a need for order and organisation. Your respectful nature makes you one of the only colours who can both lead and follow. You have no ego and people regard you with the utmost trust and respect.</p><p>Favourite past-times include: long phone calls with friends and colour coding information folders.</p>"

That’s not to say that you lose yourself in group situations, you’re loveably transparent and sincere.</p><p>Friends would describe you as well-balanced, sensible and wise, often coming to you for financial advice. You have impeccably high standards, so try not to be too hard on yourself. Everything can’t be perfect all the time.</p>"
